how to get all user_meta value for a meta key in wordpress
In WordPress, you can use the `get_user_meta()` function to retrieve the value of a user meta field for a given user. This function takes two arguments: the user ID and the meta key. For example, to get the value of a user meta field with the key "favorite_color" for the user with an ID of 123, you can use the following code:

```php
$favorite_color = get_user_meta( 123, 'favorite_color' );
```
If you want to get the values of all user meta fields with the same key, you can use the `get_users()` function to get an array of all users, and then loop through each user and call `get_user_meta()` to retrieve the value of the meta field for each user. For example:


```php
$meta_key = 'favorite_color';
$users = get_users();

foreach ( $users as $user ) {
  $user_id = $user->ID;
  $user_meta_value = get_user_meta( $user_id, $meta_key );
  
  // Do something with the user meta value...
}
```
This code will loop through all users, retrieve the value of the user meta field with the key "favorite_color" for each user, and then do something with the value (in this case, nothing is done with the value). You can modify this code to suit your needs.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
